# Wordle Clone

This is a clone of the popular word guessing game, Wordle, with a new "computer" mode that automatically generates guesses, as well as a player mode

## How It Works

- Uses a python library called Pygame to create a window, display UI, and handle player events
- a text file containing all five letter words in the English language
- Two buttons at the top, reading "computer" and "player" are used to switch game modes
- On computer mode, the "next" button generates the next automatic guess
- On player mode, it functions as the original game

## What I Learned

- Python fundamentals
- Pygame usage
- UI and events
- Processing data
- Implementing separate game states
